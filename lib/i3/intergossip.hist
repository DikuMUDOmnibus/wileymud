&R[07/22 14:41] &G&G14&W:&G41&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cThe best horrible fast food burger chain was the late "Hot and Now", around these parts.
&R[07/22 14:42] &G&G14&W:&G42&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &cthat wasn't an escort service?
&R[07/22 14:42] &G&G14&W:&G42&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cWhen they launched, they did everything right.  $0.39 hamburgers, $0.49 cheeseburgers, $1 double olive burgers, and something else I don't remember... NO CUSTOMIZATION.  You have it OUR way, drive thru only, GTFO.
&R[07/22 14:44] &G&G14&W:&G44&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cAnd that was brilliant, because it tasted just as good (bad) as any other fast food place... but it was slightly cheaper and you didn't have to spend 30 days in the drive thru behind the guy ordering for his 12 diabetic gluten-free cousin-wives who each had their own list of things they wanted.
&R[07/22 14:44] &G&G14&W:&G44&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cThey failed, later, becuase they started offering customizations and thus lost both the "hot" and "now" parts.
&R[07/22 14:45] &G&G14&W:&G45&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &ci miss when BK had two burgers and two fries for $2

&R[07/22 20:13] &G&G20&W:&G13&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cHence, 8-0 Tigers, bottom of the 3rd
&R[07/22 20:19] &G&G20&W:&G19&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &ci want to play yesterday's tigers again

&R[07/22 20:20] &G&G20&W:&G20&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cBecause Tigers fan would blow that thing up
&R[07/22 20:20] &G&G20&W:&G20&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cKilling Ausmus might only be a misdemeanor
&R[07/22 20:21] &G&G20&W:&G21&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &cor a civic duty
&R[07/22 20:21] &G&G20&W:&G21&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cDepends on if his car shrapnel hits any historic buildings
&R[07/22 20:21] &G&G20&W:&G21&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cWe'll trade you Verlander and Ausmus if you'll give us back Lloyd

&R[07/22 20:22] &G&G20&W:&G22&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &ci was glad to see lloyd not hesitate to pull rodney last night before he fully imploded away the lead
&R[07/22 20:22] &G&G20&W:&G22&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cWait
&R[07/22 20:22] &G&G20&W:&G22&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &cwut
&R[07/22 20:22] &G&G20&W:&G22&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cYou mean you can pull a pitcher BEFORE he gives up a grand slam?
&R[07/22 20:22] &G&G20&W:&G22&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &coh yes
&R[07/22 20:22] &G&G20&W:&G22&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cNext thing you'll say that a guy can pitch more than 1/3 of an inning
&R[07/22 20:23] &G&G20&W:&G23&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &cit's in the rules
&R[07/22 20:23] &G&G20&W:&G23&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cYou should have heard the amount of hate on sports radio on my drive home
&R[07/22 20:23] &G&G20&W:&G23&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &cdoes the fcc allow it?
&R[07/22 20:23] &G&G20&W:&G23&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cAt this point I'm not worried about Ausmus somehow keeping his job at the end of the season, I'm worried someone will burn his house down and crucify him on the lawn as a warning to the next guy.
&R[07/22 20:24] &G&G20&W:&G24&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cNot that Ausmus was anything less than doomed from the start.  We basically ran Leyland out of town because he lost two World Series in a total of 9 games.
&R[07/22 20:24] &G&G20&W:&G24&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CKalinash@Crat's Agony: &c8-3

&R[07/22 20:25] &G&G20&W:&G25&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cSo Ausmus had to pretty much win it all in his rookie year as a manager or he was going to be pilloried

&R[07/22 20:26] &G&G20&W:&G26&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CDuuk@Haven: &cI could, in theory, but it would get so itchy I would surely cut it

&R[07/23 04:13] &G&G04&W:&G13&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cHe made the point that because all the other candidates don't have shit tons of money, they're just puppets that have to do what their lobbyists and supporters tell them to do.
&R[07/23 04:13] &G&G04&W:&G13&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cCrude, but actually somewhat true.

&R[07/23 05:03] &G&G05&W:&G03&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CNinja@Dead Souls Dev: &cNASA's still claiming that fake moon landing in the 60's, and denying the real moon landing i the 50's.
&R[07/23 05:04] &G&G05&W:&G04&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CNinja@Dead Souls Dev: &cmeanwhile, Japan, India, China, wotever, are all competing to see who will "capture the flag" that the US left on the moon, and isn't able to retrieve.
&R[07/23 05:17] &G&G05&W:&G17&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cI'm still waiting for somebody to be clever enough to put a sattelite in orbit so that it's at the right position and distance to be directly between the earth and the moon, and then open a big old LED display for advertising.
&R[07/23 05:18] &G&G05&W:&G18&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cTonight's gibbus waxing moon brought to you, courtesy of Google.
&R[07/23 05:25] &G&G05&W:&G25&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CAhti@Dead Souls Dev: &cu want a giant foldable mirror
&R[07/23 05:28] &G&G05&W:&G28&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CAhti@Dead Souls Dev: &clike an e-ink display, leds wont do it
&R[07/23 05:31] &G&G05&W:&G31&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cYou'd need a whole array of mirrors with various polarized filters to get full color, wouldn't you?  Seems like too many moving parts.
&R[07/23 05:31] &G&G05&W:&G31&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cI mean, you want to be able to have the humans looking up at the moon see a bright, glowing Microsoft logo on the moon's surface.
&R[07/23 05:32] &G&G05&W:&G32&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CAhti@Dead Souls Dev: &cno color lets try to see the damned thing first
&R[07/23 05:32] &G&G05&W:&G32&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cSo, obviously, a large disc-shaped screen with a rear-facing camera to capture the actual moon as a dimmed backdrop for your advertising.
&R[07/23 05:33] &G&G05&W:&G33&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cpower isn't an issue... you have all the solar power you want, except during eclipses.
&R[07/23 05:36] &G&G05&W:&G36&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CAhti@Dead Souls Dev: &cthis isnt viable at all, ur fired
&R[07/23 05:36] &G&G05&W:&G36&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cHow is it not viable?
&R[07/23 05:38] &G&G05&W:&G38&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cIt's not like you need a moon-sized screen... we're talking low to mid orbit, so maybe a mile across?
&R[07/23 05:38] &G&G05&W:&G38&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cSome math people can figure that out.
&R[07/23 05:39] &G&G05&W:&G39&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cI don't think you're seeing the potential profit in this.
&R[07/23 05:39] &G&G05&W:&G39&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cYou see how much people pay for superbowl ads, right?
&R[07/23 05:40] &G&G05&W:&G40&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cImagine an ad that everyone sees when they look out the window.
&R[07/23 05:40] &G&G05&W:&G40&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cNo opting out of THAT, baby.
&R[07/23 05:40] &G&G05&W:&G40&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CAidil@Way of the Force: &cyou know how orbital speed relates to distance to the centr of gravity?
&R[07/23 05:41] &G&G05&W:&G41&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CAidil@Way of the Force: &cactually, obviously you don't, else you'd know why that isn't viable :-)
&R[07/23 05:43] &G&G05&W:&G43&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cClearly, you're just failing at math.  *throws more money at science so it behaves properly*
&R[07/23 05:45] &G&G05&W:&G45&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cPeople used to say flight wasn't possible for humans either.  Then the Wright brothers had a dream about how much money they could make from selling baggage claims and stale peanuts to people trapped in mid-air... and now, people fly all the time!
&R[07/23 06:46] &G&G06&W:&G46&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CCratylus@Dead Souls Dev: &ci have the best oribtal speed

&R[07/23 07:38] &G&G07&W:&G38&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cThe media is sending the clear message that only racist crimes matter.
&R[07/23 07:40] &G&G07&W:&G40&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cIf it had been a black guy that shot up that black church, it would have barely gotten mentioned.  If the nutball had attacked a white church people would have been sympathizing with the shooter, asking why he couldn't get the help he needed.
&R[07/23 07:40] &G&G07&W:&G40&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cBut, white guy spewing racism after killing... DING!  News coverage for a week!
&R[07/23 07:46] &G&G07&W:&G46&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cLOL, the news is now reporting on somebody who built an armed drone, with a pistol mounted on it.

&R[07/23 07:48] &G&G07&W:&G48&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cApparently it made the news because it doesn't violate any laws in Conecticut, and some people are unhappy about that.

&R[07/23 07:58] &G&G07&W:&G58&d &R[&Wintergossip&R] &CQuixadhal@Bloodlines: &cFor terrorism, rather than assassination... a drone that drops a hand grenade would be pretty effective.
