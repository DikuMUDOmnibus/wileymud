Ok, we've all sat on our butts for quite some time now.  I believe it's
about time that SOMEBODY start doing something.  Otherwise we may as well
just pack this thing up in a tar file and go play BatMUD.  To put my money
where my mouth is, I've started tweaking the help files a bit.  Anyone else
is MORE than welcome to join in.  I have a world building program if anyone
wants to build, and I can teach you the mob file format in about ten minutes.

Let's do something with this or free the 9 Megs of RAM eh?
