The Immortal Pantheon of DeadMUD Creators is split into two great segments.

     *** Respect and Admiration go the the Ancient Dead of WileyMUD II ***

--- Mad Cyric, the Destroyer.
    The implementor and head of the Old Gods.  Cyric brought forth the
    world from nothingness, and almost abolished it to nothingness again.
--- Muthaarin'akya, Essence of the World.
    God of the Map, it was He who created much of what remains.
--- Harlequin, God of the Mortal Realm.
    A God who walked the lands of Wiley, keeping order.
--- Grimwell, God of Mists and Deception.
    Devious in coding, random in nature.
--- Derkhil, Overlord of the West.
    He has taken control of much of Harlequin's western domain.
--- Elcid, Lord of the Heavens.
    One of the most ancient Gods.
--- Daisy, Mistress of the Link.
    A friend of all the Gods, it is She who binds the world in place.
--- Muidnar, the Dark Necromancer.
    Powerful and arrogant, He strives to improve the world through pain.

             *** All MUST acknowledge the New Order of DeadMUD ***

>>> Dread Quixadhal, Lord of VI.
    The driving force (whip?) behind everything you see, and much that
    you do not.  Quixadhal dragged the source of All back from the clutches
    of the Modem God, and has harnessed its powers anew.
