                 ---=>>> Welcome to Quixadhal's DeadMUD <<<=---

o First of all, I'd like to thank the people from WileyMUD for giving us
  something to ressurect in the first place!  Thanks go to Cyric for
  putting this code out somewhere I could grab it, and thanks go to Muth
  and Muidnar for digging up a copy of the world files.

o Secondly, this code has its distant origins in the standard DikuMUD
  game driver (not ROM, ENVY, or any other derivative).  However, it has
  been hacked to death by Cyric and friends for several years!  There are
  lots of FEATURES, and lots of BUGS!  Help us find both!!!

o Lastly, we are also working on an LpMUD which will eventually replace
  this DikuMUD driver.  It will take some time before it is ready, but it
  should provide for a more expandable system, and a more solid working
  environment.  Wiley II was raised from the bit bucket to provide something
  useful in the interim.  If you want to do world building, ask any of the
  immortals and they will get you docs!  If you want to help code, let us
  know!  Wiley still has room for improvement, and the LP is just starting!

                                          -Dread Quixadhal, Lord of VI.
