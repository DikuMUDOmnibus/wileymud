A demon of WileyMUD MASSACRES you with its CRUNCH!

Sorry for the inconvience, but WileyMUD III is down for the moment.

It appears that there is a nasty bug in some routine.  I shall endeavour to
recompile the WileyBeast with debugging on in the hope of catching the
demon bug red-handed and squash her.  In the mean time, be patient.
