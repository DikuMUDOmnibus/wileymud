950609	Hacklog begins anew.
	Attempting to combine some of the hacks I did earlier with the version
	that actually works.
  1826	combined magic[123].c into magic.c and spells[123].c into spells.c.
  2008	fixed signal handling for Linux.
  2025	changed default whod to only show character names... not titles.
  2035	eliminated log(), dlog(), and slog() functions from utils.c.
	added dlog() macro to bug.h and changed the two slog() calls into
	standard log() calls.
  2051	created act_comm.h file for function definitions.
  2345	restored old database routines so it should load the old format of
	database.
950610
  0145	started removing all external references from all .c files... those
	should be in header files!!!
950611
  0437	use more tricks from the running wiley..... dead bodies now have
	corpses, and you default to sleeping when you reappear in the inn.
950614
  0345	finally fixed a few nagging bugs.  nanny() has been rewritten.
	old routines like send_to_char() have been replaced with varargs
	routines like cprintf().  Now all places that used to sprintf to
	a local scratch var should be redone.... <sigh>.
	Rent is now done properly.  Pro-rated by the second and rounded
	to the nearest gold piece (truncated actually).
	I believe the code is now stable enough to try indenting and
	removing warnings.  This is now a backup copy that will run
	on a seperate port for testing, in case I'm wrong!
  0354	did a global sed on all files:
s/sbyte/BYTE/g
s/ubyte/UBYTE/g
s/sh_int/SHORT/g
s/ush_int/USHORT/g
s/byte/BYTE/g
s/bool/BYTE/g
  0402	ran all source through indent.
  0412	It compiled perfectly.... warning debugging can begin tomorrow then!
950615
  0300	fixed a bug in suicide.
	changed prompt and fixed a bug in do_score.
  0500	changed who format and added more whod options.
950617
  0530	made most menus file-based instead of hard-coded.
	changed group command to only allow the group leader to add
	people who are +/- 20%+1 of their level... thus a 2nd level
	character can only group with 1-3rd level.  a 10th level could
	group with 7-13th, a 40th would be ok with 31-49th.
	We can adjust this figure if that sounds bad.
  1120	caused villagers to wake people up on a 25% chance (always if they
	start following you).
950618
  0412	fixed bug in villager code.
  0446	added argument to score command (for immortals only).
  0456	began ridding the code of warnings.
	yywrap.c is clean.
	bug.c is almost clean:
global.h:462: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
global.h:1144: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
	these are from declarations and typedefs of the form:
	form: foo (*bar)();
	I don't know an easy and correct way to eliminate them.
	sound.c is almost clean.
	hash.c is almost clean.
	sign.c is almost clean.
	signals.c is almost clean.
	added a signals.h header file.
	magic_utils.c is almost clean.
  1234	fixed long-standing bug in act(), comm.c.  Checks for invalid
	character or location when doing a TO_ROOM action.
  1348	multiclass.c is almost clean.
  1404	act_social.c is almost clean.
  1513	changed do_who() command to allow NPC's to use who.
	Why would an unswitched npc ever use it?
  1547	trap.c would be clean if character attributes were not chars.
	We should change them to ints, but to do so would invalidate
	the player files... so until we get the ASCII save routines
	done and in place, we can't do anything about it.
  1701	changed do_look() so that one cannot see outdoors after dark.
	(if the moon is not new, you can see monsters.)
950619
  0331	tweaked do_look() a bit more to allow for dark hours between
	sunset/moonrise and especially moonset/sunrise.  also changed
	do_exits() in a similar fashion.
  0530	a bit more tweaking... added in cloud-cover.
	also, made hunger and thirst more devastating.  They do damage
	now and can kill you!
950621
  0600	changed switch command to try finding mob in room first.
	added ascii player save function.... this saves the char_file_u
	structure, rather than directly from the char_data.  Done for
	ease of porting for now.... will add read routines later.  Treat
	this as a report file until they are in.
  1354	gave immortals the ability to walk through closed doors.
  1655	found crasher in who routines... when whod ran through the character
	list, it didn't check for linkdead people, and thus segfaulted when
	it tried to access their descriptor for the idle time.
950622
  1430	Neatened up the door-walk routine a little....
950623
  0212	Fixed bugs in score... including sneak bug.
  0341	got order of class names right.
950624
  1830	Fixed bug in score... uncleared buffer made a mess of affects.
	Made Eli tell evil people he won't heal them instead of just ignoring
	them... this should help people figure out why he heals villagers but
	not them after they slaughter lots of children.
950625
  0530	Fixed a few more bugs (including pretitle) and neatened up code a bit.
	Set my room and muidnar's room to be rent areas.
  1519	Added fuzz(x) function to utils.c.  The returns a random number from
	-x to x, which can be used to slightly adjust things like zone
	reset times, etc...
950626
  0305	added a red dragon to the polymorph list (wiz only), and fixed the
	parser for that spell.  Started renaming levels (mage is done).
950630
  2100	added "all" argument to restore.. will replace restoreall command.
	changed hunger again.. you don't lose move now.
	changed score a bit more....
	player tracking now complete.
950701
  0353	added a reset command to reset zones by hand.
	added a skeleton event command, which will allow wizards to do
	complex events with minimal effort... such as loading lots of
	rats into Shylar, or bringing forth a goblin raid.
  1654	rat event done.. may need some tuning yet.
	must be set to NOT load mobs into rooms which are peaceful, or
	which have no exits.
950702
  0600	added a zone purge command.
	fixed up rat event a bit.... seems ok now.
	fixed say bug when using ' command.
950706
  1330	changed lightning bolt spell damage to be uncapped
        (L/10+ L/3 + 1)d6.... this provides a slightly lower damage at low
	levels but considerably higher damage at upper levels.  Unlike magic
	missile, one should be able to channel more electricity as they get
	higher (mm has a physical limit on the number of missiles shot).
	Also changed rat exp worth.
	Also changed fireball from L/5 to L/3.
950709
  2123	Hacked the shit out of the zombie master routines.
	Added our friendly mosquitos to the game.
950710
  0600	Fixed all the bugs I could find in zombie master's new routine.
	MUCH more intelligent now.
	added event to bring xenthia and a few followers into the world.
	be careful around shylar.... highstaff is ok but she won't last
	long!  OUt in the woods or the mountains is great.
	Shylar is ok, IF a few higher levels are on to take care of her.
	EVENTUALLY, code will be written to force her zombie hoard to
	disperse and attack Shylar when it hits 50 strong.
	(randomly distribute them throught the shylar zone until they
	are all gone... make them not follow her... make them aggressive,
	also make other mobs hate them... so the villagers will help)
	Added hate flags back to lovitar!
950717
  0700	Caught Steve cheating like a dog.  Wasted time dealing with him.
	Made defines for command numbers, and changed COMMANDO() calls
	to use them instead of the hard numbers.... This should let us
	shuffle the order around later and get rid of all the socials.
	Must go through all the code that is called by them (do_*) and
	change hard coded numbers to the defines.
950720
  0600	Tweaked gain routines a little more.
	Found tics and reset them to 70 seconds (70 *4 instead of 75 * 5)
	Added in a line to randomize it by adding 20 seconds.... commented
	out until I see if the game CAN keep up with 70 second tics.
	If so, I'll add it in so tics will be 60..80 seconds.
950721
  0831	Rewrote tick handling to use seperate counters... this makes it
	easier to see how long until the next tick occurs.... we will need
	to synchronize ticks with realtime somehow... I can't find anywhere
	that does this, so I think that's why it gets so far off.
	Tweaked a few more numbers.... ticks should now be between
	70 and 95 seconds... 
	Added ticks command to give a full summary of tick info.
	Added feature to tell immortals when the next tick will happen.
  1715	Caused meat to spoil.
	Fixed invis level to work as described.
	Fixed bug in dispel_magic... more to be done.. lots of hardcoding.
	Possible Muidnar hack fixed :)
950722
  0700	Made Eli cast refresh and bless people (make them less evil)
	Also made him cast fear at anyone > 4th level who was -900 align
  1842	Did a little bit of the prototyping for future genericism of
	spellcasting.  rangers seem to have been hacked into casting, instead
	of changing spell_info_type as should have been done... we'll have
	to change that later to accomodate druids and future classes.
950737
  1720	Hacked in ascii restore files... not fully working yet.
	also redid who a bit to include start time.
950728
  1000	Got ascii save routines to work finally.  Tweaks to axe code and
	who routines.  bug fixes for do_invis and a couple others.. minor.
	The save routines are the biggies... we can now edit player files
	with vi directly.  object save files should be next.
950729
  0700	Hopefully have Xenthia coded to disperse most of her army to Shylar
	when she gets 50 of them!  This will be cool if it works.
	Fixed a couple more little things.
