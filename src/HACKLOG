950609	Hacklog begins anew.
	Attempting to combine some of the hacks I did earlier with the version
	that actually works.
  1826	combined magic[123].c into magic.c and spells[123].c into spells.c.
  2008	fixed signal handling for Linux.
  2025	changed default whod to only show character names... not titles.
  2035	eliminated log(), dlog(), and slog() functions from utils.c.
	added dlog() macro to bug.h and changed the two slog() calls into
	standard log() calls.
  2051	created act_comm.h file for function definitions.
  2345	restored old database routines so it should load the old format of
	database.
950610
  0145	started removing all external references from all .c files... those
	should be in header files!!!
950611
  0437	use more tricks from the running wiley..... dead bodies now have
	corpses, and you default to sleeping when you reappear in the inn.
