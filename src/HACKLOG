950609	Hacklog begins anew.
	Attempting to combine some of the hacks I did earlier with the version
	that actually works.
  1826	combined magic[123].c into magic.c and spells[123].c into spells.c.
  2008	fixed signal handling for Linux.
  2025	changed default whod to only show character names... not titles.
  2035	eliminated log(), dlog(), and slog() functions from utils.c.
	added dlog() macro to bug.h and changed the two slog() calls into
	standard log() calls.
  2051	created act_comm.h file for function definitions.
  2345	restored old database routines so it should load the old format of
	database.
950610
  0145	started removing all external references from all .c files... those
	should be in header files!!!
950611
  0437	use more tricks from the running wiley..... dead bodies now have
	corpses, and you default to sleeping when you reappear in the inn.
950614
  0345	finally fixed a few nagging bugs.  nanny() has been rewritten.
	old routines like send_to_char() have been replaced with varargs
	routines like cprintf().  Now all places that used to sprintf to
	a local scratch var should be redone.... <sigh>.
	Rent is now done properly.  Pro-rated by the second and rounded
	to the nearest gold piece (truncated actually).
	I believe the code is now stable enough to try indenting and
	removing warnings.  This is now a backup copy that will run
	on a seperate port for testing, in case I'm wrong!
  0354	did a global sed on all files:
s/sbyte/BYTE/g
s/ubyte/UBYTE/g
s/sh_int/SHORT/g
s/ush_int/USHORT/g
s/byte/BYTE/g
s/bool/BYTE/g
  0402	ran all source through indent.
  0412	It compiled perfectly.... warning debugging can begin tomorrow then!
950615
  0300	fixed a bug in suicide.
	changed prompt and fixed a bug in do_score.
  0500	changed who format and added more whod options.
950617
  0530	made most menus file-based instead of hard-coded.
	changed group command to only allow the group leader to add
	people who are +/- 20%+1 of their level... thus a 2nd level
	character can only group with 1-3rd level.  a 10th level could
	group with 7-13th, a 40th would be ok with 31-49th.
	We can adjust this figure if that sounds bad.
  1120	caused villagers to wake people up on a 25% chance (always if they
	start following you).
950618
  0412	fixed bug in villager code.
  0446	added argument to score command (for immortals only).
  0456	began ridding the code of warnings.
	yywrap.c is clean.
	bug.c is almost clean:
global.h:462: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
global.h:1144: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
	these are from declarations and typedefs of the form:
	form: foo (*bar)();
	I don't know an easy and correct way to eliminate them.
	sound.c is almost clean.
	hash.c is almost clean.
	sign.c is almost clean.
	signals.c is almost clean.
	added a signals.h header file.
	magic_utils.c is almost clean.
  1234	fixed long-standing bug in act(), comm.c.  Checks for invalid
	character or location when doing a TO_ROOM action.
  1348	multiclass.c is almost clean.
  1404	act_social.c is almost clean.
  1513	changed do_who() command to allow NPC's to use who.
	Why would an unswitched npc ever use it?
  1547	trap.c would be clean if character attributes were not chars.
	We should change them to ints, but to do so would invalidate
	the player files... so until we get the ASCII save routines
	done and in place, we can't do anything about it.
  1701	changed do_look() so that one cannot see outdoors after dark.
	(if the moon is not new, you can see monsters.)
950619
  0331	tweaked do_look() a bit more to allow for dark hours between
	sunset/moonrise and especially moonset/sunrise.  also changed
	do_exits() in a similar fashion.
  0530	a bit more tweaking... added in cloud-cover.
	also, made hunger and thirst more devastating.  They do damage
	now and can kill you!
950621
  0600	changed switch command to try finding mob in room first.
	added ascii player save function.... this saves the char_file_u
	structure, rather than directly from the char_data.  Done for
	ease of porting for now.... will add read routines later.  Treat
	this as a report file until they are in.
  1354	gave immortals the ability to walk through closed doors.
  1655	found crasher in who routines... when whod ran through the character
	list, it didn't check for linkdead people, and thus segfaulted when
	it tried to access their descriptor for the idle time.
950622
  1430	Neatened up the door-walk routine a little....
950623
  0212	Fixed bugs in score... including sneak bug.
  0341	got order of class names right.
950624
  1830	Fixed bug in score... uncleared buffer made a mess of affects.
	Made Eli tell evil people he won't heal them instead of just ignoring
	them... this should help people figure out why he heals villagers but
	not them after they slaughter lots of children.
950625
  0530	Fixed a few more bugs (including pretitle) and neatened up code a bit.
	Set my room and muidnar's room to be rent areas.
  1519	Added fuzz(x) function to utils.c.  The returns a random number from
	-x to x, which can be used to slightly adjust things like zone
	reset times, etc...
950626
  0305	added a red dragon to the polymorph list (wiz only), and fixed the
	parser for that spell.  Started renaming levels (mage is done).
950630
  2100	added "all" argument to restore.. will replace restoreall command.
	changed hunger again.. you don't lose move now.
	changed score a bit more....
	player tracking now complete.
950701
  0353	added a reset command to reset zones by hand.
	added a skeleton event command, which will allow wizards to do
	complex events with minimal effort... such as loading lots of
	rats into Shylar, or bringing forth a goblin raid.
  1654	rat event done.. may need some tuning yet.
	must be set to NOT load mobs into rooms which are peaceful, or
	which have no exits.
950702
  0600	added a zone purge command.
	fixed up rat event a bit.... seems ok now.
	fixed say bug when using ' command.
950706
  1330	changed lightning bolt spell damage to be uncapped
        (L/10+ L/3 + 1)d6.... this provides a slightly lower damage at low
	levels but considerably higher damage at upper levels.  Unlike magic
	missile, one should be able to channel more electricity as they get
	higher (mm has a physical limit on the number of missiles shot).
	Also changed rat exp worth.
	Also changed fireball from L/5 to L/3.
950709
  2123	Hacked the shit out of the zombie master routines.
	Added our friendly mosquitos to the game.
950710
  0600	Fixed all the bugs I could find in zombie master's new routine.
	MUCH more intelligent now.
	added event to bring xenthia and a few followers into the world.
	be careful around shylar.... highstaff is ok but she won't last
	long!  OUt in the woods or the mountains is great.
	Shylar is ok, IF a few higher levels are on to take care of her.
	EVENTUALLY, code will be written to force her zombie hoard to
	disperse and attack Shylar when it hits 50 strong.
	(randomly distribute them throught the shylar zone until they
	are all gone... make them not follow her... make them aggressive,
	also make other mobs hate them... so the villagers will help)
	Added hate flags back to lovitar!
950717
  0700	Caught Steve cheating like a dog.  Wasted time dealing with him.
	Made defines for command numbers, and changed COMMANDO() calls
	to use them instead of the hard numbers.... This should let us
	shuffle the order around later and get rid of all the socials.
	Must go through all the code that is called by them (do_*) and
	change hard coded numbers to the defines.
950720
  0600	Tweaked gain routines a little more.
	Found tics and reset them to 70 seconds (70 *4 instead of 75 * 5)
	Added in a line to randomize it by adding 20 seconds.... commented
	out until I see if the game CAN keep up with 70 second tics.
	If so, I'll add it in so tics will be 60..80 seconds.
950721
  0831	Rewrote tick handling to use seperate counters... this makes it
	easier to see how long until the next tick occurs.... we will need
	to synchronize ticks with realtime somehow... I can't find anywhere
	that does this, so I think that's why it gets so far off.
	Tweaked a few more numbers.... ticks should now be between
	70 and 95 seconds... 
	Added ticks command to give a full summary of tick info.
	Added feature to tell immortals when the next tick will happen.
  1715	Caused meat to spoil.
	Fixed invis level to work as described.
	Fixed bug in dispel_magic... more to be done.. lots of hardcoding.
	Possible Muidnar hack fixed :)
950722
  0700	Made Eli cast refresh and bless people (make them less evil)
	Also made him cast fear at anyone > 4th level who was -900 align
  1842	Did a little bit of the prototyping for future genericism of
	spellcasting.  rangers seem to have been hacked into casting, instead
	of changing spell_info_type as should have been done... we'll have
	to change that later to accomodate druids and future classes.
950737
  1720	Hacked in ascii restore files... not fully working yet.
	also redid who a bit to include start time.
950728
  1000	Got ascii save routines to work finally.  Tweaks to axe code and
	who routines.  bug fixes for do_invis and a couple others.. minor.
	The save routines are the biggies... we can now edit player files
	with vi directly.  object save files should be next.
950729
  0700	Hopefully have Xenthia coded to disperse most of her army to Shylar
	when she gets 50 of them!  This will be cool if it works.
	Fixed a couple more little things.
950907
  0506	Yup.. haven't kept loggint thigns :)
	Added taunting to players who get killed: "A villager mocks..."
	Cleaned up spells a bit.... up to the c's.
950919	Quixadhal
  0630	EEK!  No logs!  Argh!  Ok, fixed astral a bit more....
	Also changed whod to we level 59ers are something more than just
	a Whizz... :)
950922  Sedna
  0417  Had a really bad day at work and decided to take it out on wiley
        players... :^)  I made the butler friends with the banker.  That
        is, if you have less gold on you than what it takes to rent, you
        can rent with what you have in the bank.  Conversely, if you re-
        enter the game and ran out of gold in your pocket, the game will
        deduct the difference from your bank account, telling you:
        "You ran out of gold and had to make a quick trip to the bank."

        It will call you a deadbeat only after draining both your pocket
        and your bankbook.  :^)
951003	Dirk
  1800	Added cure blindness and remove poison to Eli, but only if you are
	very good (above 750 align) Right now it's cut and pasted from the
	other ones, so if you are under 750 and need help, he will either
	say you are wicked, or bless you. I may change that, so he won't
	cast bless on you if you are under 750. You'll just need to be that
	good for him to help you.
  1950	Added the hack where he won't bless you now if you're under 750, he'll
	just tell you that you aren't good enough, and he will let you suffer
951106  Sedna
  0140  Wrote a line in act_comm.c which sends a message to player when they
        appear which is identical to the message they receive when invisibility
        wears off.  "You feel exposed."
951119	Quixadhal
  0332	Lots of changes have not been logged... Here are a few.
	o	Modified group code so that it works correctly.
		People can group withing lvl/2 of their leader.
		group members no longer get pasted by area affects.
		exp is PROPERLY distributed to all group members, but
		people who are not in the room will get 1/10 of their share.
		NOTE: the other 9/10 is LOST as a penalty for the rest of
		the group to discourage wimps and slackers.
	o	summoning/animate spells now have a chance of making the
		target turn on the caster.... wouldn't YOU be pissed?
	o	colour-spray can paralyze very low level monsters.
	o	meat spoils and becomes poisonous.
	o	a village guard patrols shylar.
	o	charm monster/charm person are now based on the humanoid
		status of the target.
	o	registered players get a 10% exp bonus, but can no longer
		disable summon or teleport.  Also, anyone can now tell
		a reg'd player by looking at them.
	o	added a rentmode command to enable/disable rent costs.
		it should eventually save the state in a file, but for
		now you can toggle it by hand.
	o	added more parameters to pset command.
	o	removed nasties that had energy_drain spells from the
		undead mobs in event undead.... that was too much.
	o	probably more changes that I can't recall.. but that's what
		I get for ignoring logs.... let's all promise to be nice
		hackers and keep this file up to date ok?
  0518	Added messages for rebooting... also neatened up the time command.
	Made Eli turn undead.
	Should change spell_turn() in magic.c so that:
		if the caster is good and they are maybe twice as high level
		as the mob, the mob should be killed instead of forced to
		flee.
		if the caster is evil and they are twice as high, the mob
		should become a follower for a limited duration.
		(IE: charm monster)
951125	Quixadhal
  1944	Hacked comm.c to retry socket initialization every second for a minute.
951130  Sedna
        Modified the act_mobile to stop a mob from following a player after
		their charm wears off.
	Modified the puke function so that instead of a simple emote, it
		actually deducts 2 from the player's fullness and does one
		point of hit damage for puking.
951203	Quixadhal
  2102	Fixed puke and exempted gods from the damaging effects.
	Reclaimed immortal status for myself alone while the minor Gods
	shuffle and fight amongst themselves.
951209	Quixadhal
  1754	Fixed exit command to be friendly to immortals.
951210	Quixadhal
  2334	Modified stat command, added doh social, added half-done clone
	spell.  Minor tweaks that I forgot to log yesterday.
  0006	Removed cust command... replaced with more useful doh emote :)
	Removed lroom command... replaced with " alias for tell.
	Modified interpreter to allow no-spaces between ' " , and : for
	the say, tell, gtell, and emote commands resp.
  0101	Prevented slaying of greater gods by lesser gods... they have to
	kill us the hard way.
  0118	Made emote tell you "You emote: ..." if echo is on.
951213	Quixadhal
  2330	Alphabetized the spell assignment lists in spell_parser.c.
  2235	Hacked rent-mode so it accepts an argument... this is a floating
	point number which is the rent multiplier.  IE: rentmode 1.5 should
	make things cost half again as much as usual.
  2356	Fixed restore to disallow any but "all" for < 56th level... we
	can now free the restoreall command slot.
