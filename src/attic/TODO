Quixadhal's List of Impossible Tasks:

o Remove all unused functions from the source.
o Remove anything that is #ifdef'd out.
o Rewrite all "stupid" functions like MAX() and str_cmp().
o Finish rebalancing spell code.
o Create calling interfaces for non-implemented spells.
o Finish druid class.
o Move fighters/ranger/thief skills into a single table with mage/clerics.
o Redefine the costs and levels for the spells... some powerful ones are
  acquired too soon, some wimpy ones take too long to get.
o Make all the wizard commands have a common interface style.
o Update documentation!!!
o Change the way skills are handled.  Entires already exist in the spell
  lists, so let's use them!  Create function pointers to the skills so that
  the actual application of a skill calls the function.  This way we can
  encode levels and mana costs in here.. we just need to have a way to
  prevent people from "cast 'hide' self".
o Lots more to list, but this is a start.
